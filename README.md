MotaWord
=================================
This API SDK was initially generated by APIMATIC BETA v2.0, and then refactored and edited 
for better compliance and usability with MotaWord API.

How To Install:
=================================
This library uses Composer to manage dependencies. In your application, issue this command:

`composer require motaword/sdk`

How To Get Started: 
=================================
For comprehensive examples, check `/examples` folder. You only need to enter your API client ID and secret, then you are
good to go with API methods.

How To Receive API Credentials:
=================================
Just go to https://www.motaword.com/developer and create a developer account. Once you confirm your email address, you will
be able to create an API client for yourself, or an "App" as we call API clients.

After creating your app, you will be able to see your credentials, log your activity, 
track your projects in your client dashboard and enter payment details.
